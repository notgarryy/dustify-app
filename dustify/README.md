# Dustify [W.I.P.]
Dustify is a portable ambient particulate analyzer designed to monitor air quality, specifically measuring PM2.5 and PM10 levels. It uses an ESP32-S3 microcontroller to collect sensor data and send it to a smartphone via Bluetooth. The application provides real-time air quality monitoring and allows users to manage connected devices efficiently.

## Features
- Real-time Air Quality Monitoring: Measures PM2.5 and PM10 levels using the Sensirion SPS30 sensor.
- Bluetooth Connectivity: Connects to the Dustify device using Bluetooth.
- Device Management: Add, remove, and filter connected devices.
- User Interface: Displays connected devices in a ListTile format with options to delete or add a new device.
- Persistent Storage: Saves connected device details using SharedPreferences.
